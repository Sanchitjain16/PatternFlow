Hi everyone, 
This is the final demo (i.e., report assessment) for my course.
I am doing the **TASK 1** *to segment the ISIC data set with the improved UNet.*
*Also, all the labels must have a minimum Dice similarity coefficient of 0.8*.

U-Net architecture was introduced by Olaf Ronneberger, Philipp Fischer, 
Thomas Brox in 2015 for tumor detection but since has been found to be 
useful across multiple industries This U-shaped architecture mainly 
consists of Convolutional layers implemented in a specific way. No Dense 
layer is presented in model.

ISIC 2017 dataset will be used to train and implement this model and 
identify the skin tumour.
